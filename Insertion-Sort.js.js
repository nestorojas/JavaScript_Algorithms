 Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards.  Start with an empty left hand
and the cards face down on the table, remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the
correct position in the left hand.  To find the correct position for a card, compare it with each of 
the cards already in the hand from rigth to left

/*
Start at the beginning of the list and take second element and compared with the first element, either the 0 index or the 1 index, depending if it's smaller or larger than our first element. 
We now have a sorted list of length 2. We then continue on down the line, inserting elements in our sorted side of the list as the unsorted side becomes smaller.

Big O 
There are 2 nested for loops. Two nested loops means O(nÂ²) in the worst case scenario. 
Depending on the original order, if the list is closed to sorted, it can be O(n) in a best case scenario and thus well adapted to that scenario.
